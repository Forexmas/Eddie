        <h1>Hi TD,</h1>
        <p class="message">
            Today is kinda extraordinary. Please read this in silence and alone. 
            This seems a little off and not something youâ€™re ready for. 
            Breathe-inâ€¦ And Breathe-outâ€¦ Hope it helped ðŸ¤­.<br><br>
            
            I was always waiting for a perfect day for this but the plot twist is youâ€™d never know 
            the day it is when you keep waiting for it. Every bit of you, from how I met you till now, 
            has been so mystical. I barely took contacts of people I donâ€™t know but yours was one of 
            the mysteries. You have this superb energy that revolves around you which makes me admire 
            you a lot. Everyoneâ€™s got inner battles but mine seizes to exist whenever I text or talk to you. 
            You possess everything Iâ€™m searching for in someone Iâ€™d love to be with. Your whole personality 
            is a high level top notch ðŸ˜Œ.<br><br>

            Others have their own interpretation of love. However, I see it as a journey. 
            We grow in it and live in it. Love is ignoring all flaws of someone and cherishing the person 
            regardless. We havenâ€™t met in person but then bonds have no boundaries. I know for a fact you get 
            scared of distant relationships, which is very normal. But Iâ€™ll try everything in my power to make 
            this work even in cloudy days.<br><br>
            
            No rush on this. Letâ€™s take it cool and study. Are you ready and willing to begin this journey with me? 
            Please feel free to let me know if youâ€™re not interested in this proposal because love is magical and canâ€™t be forced ðŸ˜Š.<br><br>

            I admire you a lot TD ðŸ«‚ðŸ’ž
